Linked Lists Project from The Odin Project

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that "point" to the next node by means of a pointer.

Each node holds a single element of data and a link or pointer to the next node in the list.

A head node is the first node in the list, a tail node is the last node in the list.
